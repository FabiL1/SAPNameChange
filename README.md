# SAP Name Changes

This repository attempts to record SAP's frequent name changes.
It is clear that every name change is not necessarily a name change, as it can also be a new product.
To give a rough guide, "R/3 --> S/4" is a name change.

The goal is to generate a small GitHub Pages page from it with a good dataset.

The first data is from these two blog pages:
